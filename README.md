# What is Kattis?
Kattis is a computer science / mathematical problem archive. It judges your programmatic solutions to said problems by appliying your
program to several hidden test cases and verifying output (CPU time is also a constraint!). 
It is great practice for increasing skills in problem solving, mathematics, and programming.

Here is the source code of most of the Kattis problems I have solved.
