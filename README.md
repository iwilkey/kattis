# What is Kattis?
Kattis is a online programming problem archive. It judges your algorithmic solutions to said problems by appliying your
program to several hidden test cases and verifying output. It is great practice for increasing skills in problem solving, mathematics, and programming.

Here is the source code of most of the Kattis problems I have solved.
