# What is Kattis?
Kattis is an online programming problem archive. You are prompted with a mathematical word problem and sample input and output then are expected to submit
a general solution using a programming language that can produce the correct output for hidden test cases. It is a great tool to practice
one's mathematical reasoning, increase one's programming skill set, and refine one's general problem solving.

This GitHub repository is a collection of most of my accepted programmatic solutions to Kattis problems identified by the folder names I organize them in.
