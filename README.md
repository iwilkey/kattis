# What is Kattis?
Kattis is an online programming problem archive. You are prompted with a mathematical word problem and sample IO and are challenged to submit
a general solution using a programmatically implemented algorithm that can produce the correct output for hidden test cases. It is a great tool to practice
one's mathematical reasoning, increase their programming skill set, and refine their general problem solving.

This GitHub repository is a collection of most of my accepted solutions to Kattis problems identified by the folder names I organize them in.
